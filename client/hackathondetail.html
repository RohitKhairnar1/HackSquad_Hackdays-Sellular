			<p>Our hackathon is a 24-hour event where participants come together to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. This is an opportunity to showcase your skills, work on exciting projects, and network with like-minded individuals.</p>
			<p>The theme for this year's hackathon is "Building a Sustainable Future." We believe that technology can play a crucial role in addressing some of the most pressing environmental challenges that we face today, and we want to see what you can come up with!</p>
			<p>Whether you're a seasoned developer, a designer, or a student, we welcome all participants with diverse backgrounds and skill sets to join us for a weekend of creativity and collaboration.</p>
			<p>The event will take place on the weekend of April 15-16, 2023, and will be held virtually. The event will kick off on Friday evening, and teams will have until Saturday evening to complete their projects. We will provide mentorship and resources throughout the event to help you build the best possible solution.</p>
